# NAT (Natural Abstract Tree) Language v3.6.1

A simple, English-style compiled programming language written in pure C.
Designed to read like natural English — no symbols where words will do.
This language was created by Nisarg with the help of Claude Sonet Model.
The earliest version V1.0 and V2.0 of NAT was written by me, but it has so many bugs,
that i had to take help of Sonet to make it stable. So it changed my code and edited it
to a better and stable form.

When I first started learning about coding, i was curious about how a coding langauge was created, how did Dennis Ritchie created C and why C performs better than other languages. This made me do Research in coding and at the mid-sem of my second year (yup, I am a college student), I thought of the idea of creating my own language which is simple to understand and is fun to write. I created the first version, the V1.0 and 2.0, had very basic tokenizer and parser and that too in one main.c file, which didnt allowed multi-line code and Idents were broken, this made me give up on the project but then I realised this is an era of AI, so why not use AI for Research and Development of this project, so I first asked ChatGPT about creating a langauge and it told me that its possible to create by taking source code of Python but I didnt want to use any open source project as this projects didnt have what I want, so I uploaded my broken main.c file to Claude and to my suprise, it understood the method, the code structure, my ideology and improved my main.c into seperate parser, token etc files and from there the first stable version of my Language was created "V3.0", it also become my coding partner. I code and It improves it.

I hope the devs will check this project.

NAT lets you write code that reads like plain English — no semicolons, no curly braces, no boilerplate. It compiles and runs your `.nat` files directly, with clear, friendly error messages that actually tell you what went wrong.

```nat
let name be "Nisarg".
let age be 21.

show "Hello, " and name.
show "Age: " and age.

if age is greater than 18:
    show "Access granted.".
end.
```

---

## Why NAT?

- **Reads like English** — `let x be 10.` instead of `int x = 10;`
- **Friendly errors** — tells you exactly what went wrong and how to fix it
- **Batteries included** — standard library for math, geometry, strings, and unit conversion
- **Module system** — import `.tree` files with `use math.tree`
- **File I/O** — read, write, append, insert, delete lines from files
- **Graph output** — `create graph` generates HTML charts instantly

---

## Installation (Windows)

1. Download the latest release zip from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Extract the folder anywhere (e.g. `C:\NAT\`)
3. Add the folder to your system PATH
4. Open a terminal and run:

```
nat hello.nat
```

> Linux/Mac: compile from source with `gcc *.c -o nat -lm`

---

## Quick Start

**hello.nat**
```nat
show "Hello, World!".
```

Run it:
```
nat hello.nat
```

**Variables and math:**
```nat
let x be 10.
let y be 20.
let sum be x + y.
show sum.
```

**Functions:**
```nat
make greet with name inside:
    show "Hello, " and name.
end.

greet("Nisarg").
```

**Loops:**
```nat
repeat 5 times:
    show "NAT is great.".
end.

repeat i from 1 to 10:
    show i.
end.
```

**Arrays:**
```nat
let fruits are "apple" "mango" "banana".
each item in fruits:
    show item.
end.
```

**File I/O:**
```nat
write "Hello" to "notes.txt".
append "World" to "notes.txt".
read "notes.txt".

each line in file "notes.txt":
    show line.
end.
```

**Using the standard library:**
```nat
use math.tree
show sqrt 144.
show pow(2, 10).

use geometry.tree
show area_rect 5, 3.
```

## Standard Library

| File | What's inside |
|------|--------------|
| `math.tree` | `sqrt`, `pow`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, `abs`, `floor`, `ceil`, `PI`, `E` and more |
| `geometry.tree` | Area and perimeter for 2D/3D shapes, coordinate geometry, vectors |
| `string.tree` | `capitalize`, `count_words`, `pad_left`, `starts_with`, `ends_with` and more |
| `convert.tree` | km↔miles, °C↔°F, kg↔lbs, radians↔degrees and more |

## Building from Source

Requires GCC.

```bash
cd compiler
gcc *.c -o nat.exe -lm
```

## Language Syntax at a Glance

```nat
// Variables
let x be 10.
let name be "NAT".
let x, y, z.           // declare multiple

// Assignment
x be 20.
x = 20.                // = also works

// Conditionals
if x is greater than 5:
    show "big".
else:
    show "small".
end.

// While loop
while x is greater than 0:
    x be x - 1.
end.

// Functions
make add with a b inside:
    give a + b.
end.

let result be add(3, 4).

// Constants
fix PI be 3.14159.

// Ask user input
ask for name.
show "You entered: " and name.

// File I/O
write "text" to "file.txt".
append "more" to "file.txt".
let line be read "file.txt" at line 1.
if file "file.txt" exists:
    delete file "file.txt".
end.
```
